There is a mobile game I used to play as a kid called Mr Jump. This is my attempt at replicating that game. It has multiple levels and multiple worlds. The goal is to jump over spikes and pits. The game is a moving 2d screen where the character stays planted while the scenery moves. The goal is to make it to the end. When you die you are presented with the percentage of the world that you completed: your score.
